After testing all of the data from the misspelling.csv file, I found that with some of the words the
program worked really well, and with other words it did not work well at all. After testing the words
from the list on all different counts varying from 3-7, I found that for about 25% of the mis-spelled
words that I tried, in the lists that were returned the correct spelling of the word could not be
found at all. For the remaining 75% of the mis-spelled words, the correct spelling was found in at
least one of the returned lists. Of those 75%, I found that on average I would see the correct spelling
of the word in about 40% of the lists that were returned for one word. In my implementation, in order to
try and get the correct spelling of the input tokens we could use data for the most commonly mis-spelled
words in the implementation instead of the most frequently used words. If data with the correct spelling
of the most commonly mis-spelled words was input into the program, we could use that data along with an
input count that is only plus or minus 2 of the mis-spelled input word to almost definitely get the
correct word.
